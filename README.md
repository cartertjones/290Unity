<h3>Leapfrog Parkour Masters</h3>
To make the game more enjoyable, I added some feedback and a new goal to the game.
Now, the goal is to reach 10 points first, and your character makes noise whenever you jump.

Implemented inventory system to track points and other future items

Enhanced level and added a new squish ability accessible via player's respective control key. Instead of simply jumping over players to score, you must squish them now.
